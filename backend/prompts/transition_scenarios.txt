You are modelling transition climate risk scenarios for [COMPANY_NAME]. Using ONLY the supplied evidence, craft concise comparative narratives that highlight financial exposures and strategic adaptability across three macro transition pathways.

Evidence packet:
---
[SCENARIO_EVIDENCE]
---

Instructions:
- Do not fabricate data. Quote quantitative values explicitly present in the evidence and cite each statement as "(source: URL)".
- If a data point is missing, flag it as "Information not found" instead of guessing.
- Focus on transition mechanisms (policy changes, carbon pricing, technology uptake, demand shifts, financing) not physical climate hazards.
