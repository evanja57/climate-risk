 # High Priority
 [x] remove absolute path from artifacts page
 [x] change source citing into wikipedia style supertext numbers that link to a sources section at the bottom with clickable url's
 [] add a download report button on the report tab
 [] add backend output tracking on the frontent so user can see progress in real time
 [x] don't show previous report output once a new report begins running (perhaps showing progress output instead)
 [x] don't show the 'report, raw json, artifacts' component before a report has been run
 [x] change the risk assessment overall result yellow box from changing to a weird color on hover

 # Medium priority
 - Add more tunable input paramaters to run_assessment (with fields to input them on the frontent)
    - such as EBITDA, total revenue, segmented revenue
    - perhaps remove the max_results and PDF cap and keep them standardized
 - make it so if i open the json on the raw json tab then go back to report tab the json persists as out
 - figure out why report_raw.txt and evidence.md download is unavailable
 - remove the hashing/uniqueness qualifier from making it into the evidence file or at the least on the displayed evidence in the artifacts tab
